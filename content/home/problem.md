## Our Healthcare System is facing challenges

* Healthcare Professionals have limited time, but demand is growing
* Medical Knowledge increases faster than anyone can keep up with
* Overall costs are rising, but budgets are limited
* Counter-productive incentives innate to the system obstruct better outcomes
* Regulations hinder innovations by startups and outsider tech giants alike

---

## Not to mention Healthcare IT systems

* Guidelines, terminologies and best practices are not automated
* There is a fragmented landscape of partial solution providers only
* Information on a single patient is shattered everywhere
* Interoperability and information exchange are still in the stone age
* Outdated technologies are common place, even in the core of the system
